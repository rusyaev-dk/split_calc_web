**A scalable Flutter app starter template based on Clean Architecture with modular feature organization.**
</div>

## 📘 About

This template provides a solid foundation for production-ready Flutter apps with:

* 🧱 Modular architecture
* 🧪 Built-in environment support
* 🌐 Declarative routing (`go_router`)
* 🔐 Secure and shared storage
* 🔄 `flutter_bloc` state management
* 📦 Ready-to-use DI and logging
* 🌍 Localization support

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The template follows Clean Architecture principles with a specific adjustment:

> 🟡 **Interactors (use cases)** live in the `domain/` layer
> 🟡 **BLoC/Cubit logic** lives in the `presentation/` layer

```
🔐 PRESENTATION
Widgets, Screens, BLoC, Cubit

🔐 DOMAIN
Business Logic, Entities, Interactors

🔐 DATA
Repositories, APIs, Storage, DTOs
```

## 🌟 Goals

* 🏁 Kickstart new apps in minutes
* 🧱 Encourage consistency and scalability
* 🧪 Enable testability and clean separation
* 👥 Fit team-based and long-term projects
